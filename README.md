1. The Calculator Project ‚úçÔ∏è: This Calculator Project is about making a calculator prototye. The main goals of the projects are:
<br>
a. To ask users what kind of mathematical operation they would like to do out of the four choices - Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division
<br>
b. Prompt the users to insert two numerical values
<br>
c. Perform the calculation and display the answers clearly.
<br>
<br>
2. The Modified Calculator Project: In the prototype of the calculator program, the following aspects are added:
<br>
‚Ä¢	Repeating (the user can perform arithmetic calculations repeatedly and without restarting the program every time) and ending the program as per choice.
<br>
‚Ä¢	Adding comments and explaining the code structures and elements.
<br>
‚Ä¢	Adding additional mathematical functionality, e.g., advanced/scientific calculations, ability to do arithmetic calculations with more than two values. üöÄüöÄ
